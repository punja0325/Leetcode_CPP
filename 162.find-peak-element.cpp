 *
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 *
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
 * index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the
 * peaks.
 *
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
 * always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
 * array.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
 * number 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
 * element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

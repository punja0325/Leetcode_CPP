 *
 * Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in
 * non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific
 * target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2]
 * where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
 *
 * Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an
 * integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
 *
 * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not
 * use the same element twice.
 *
 * Your solution must use only constant extra space.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We
 * return [1, 2].
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
 * Output: [1,3]
 * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We
 * return [1, 3].
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We
 * return [1, 2].
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
 * -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
 * numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * -1000 <= target <= 1000
 * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

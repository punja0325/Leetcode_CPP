 *
 * You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
 * 
 * Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can
 * you climb to the top?
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
 * 1. 1 step + 1 step
 * 2. 2 steps
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
 * 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
 * 2. 1 step + 2 steps
 * 3. 2 steps + 1 step
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 45
